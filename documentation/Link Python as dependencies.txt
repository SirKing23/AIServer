Link Python as dependencies
1. Locate your Python installation directory

In cmd, run: where python

2. Find the include folder
ex: C:\Users\King\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\include
ðŸ‘‰ This folder contains Python.h and other headers.

3. Add it in Visual Studio

Open your project in Visual Studio 2022

Right-click your project â†’ Properties

Go to:
Configuration Properties > C/C++ > General > Additional Include Directories

Add the path to your Python include folder, e.g.:

C:\Users\King\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\include

4. Also add the libs folder

Youâ€™ll need the .lib files for linking.
In your Python root, youâ€™ll see:

C:\Users\King\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\libs


Add that in:

Configuration Properties > Linker > General > Additional Library Directories


And then link against python311.lib:

Configuration Properties > Linker > Input > Additional Dependencies


Add:

python311.lib
